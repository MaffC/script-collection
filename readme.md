Preface
-------

I write scripts a lot. Partly as a hobby, partly to make my own work easier and partly for my job.
I tend to choose whatever language is most appropriate for what I'm doing, although I usually prefer Bash.

Scripts
-------

This readme contains an up to date list of all scripts in the repo + their descriptions:
- nscheck: Bash - DNS diagnosis script
