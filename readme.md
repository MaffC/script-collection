Preface
-------

I write scripts a lot. Partly as a hobby, partly to make my own work easier and partly for my job.
I tend to choose whatever language is most appropriate for what I'm doing, although I usually prefer Bash.

This readme contains an up to date list of all scripts in the repo + their descriptions:
- aslookup: Perl - Script to look up ASN information for a given IP or ASN
- ifls: Perl - Script to collect all interfaces on the system and provide an easily-viewed list of their IPs
- mailview: Perl - Script to parse HTML email and format it in a text-reader-friendly way.
- nscheck: Bash - DNS diagnosis script
- pscrot: Perl - OSX-oriented but likely easily ported daemon for uploading screenshots and such.
- watchd & watchd.conf: Bash - Script designed to run as a cronjob, alerting the user to any events.
