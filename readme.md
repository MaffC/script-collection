Preface
-------

I write scripts a lot. Partly as a hobby, partly to make my own work easier and partly for my job.
I tend to choose whatever language is most appropriate for what I'm doing, although I usually prefer Bash.

Scripts
-------

This readme contains an up to date list of all scripts in the repo + their descriptions:
- mailview: Perl - Script to parse HTML email and format it in a text-reader-friendly way.
- nscheck: Bash - DNS diagnosis script
- paster: Bash - Script to take standard input and 'paste' it to a pastebin site.
- watchd & watchd.conf: Bash - Script designed to run as a cronjob, alerting the user to any events.
